The **UH Drone Technologies VIP Team** project focused on designing and fabricating modular drone hardware:  

- **LiDAR Mount:**  
  Developed a mount system to secure the LiDAR unit, Jetson, power bank, and battery.  
  - Used dovetail joints for oversized parts that exceeded the 3D printer build plate.  
  - Modular structure improved assembly, maintenance, and weight balance.  

- **Landing Gear:**  
  Redesigned the UAV landing gear to fit in standard luggage for transport.  
  - Replaced fragile PLA/carbon-fiber parts with TPU for shock absorption and flexibility.  
  - Identified TPU’s excessive flexibility during testing, leading to PETG prototypes for better stiffness and stability.  

**Tools:** Onshape CAD, FDM 3D printing, material testing.  

This project improved the drone’s **portability and durability**, supporting reliable field deployment.
