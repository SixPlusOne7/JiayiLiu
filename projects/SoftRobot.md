The **Jellyfish Inspired Underwater Robot** was designed in the Soft Robotics and Intelligent Machines Laboratory (SAIL).  
It combines **soft actuators** with a **modular assembly** to create a versatile robotic platform:

- Pneumatic actuators for pulsatile propulsion and flexible grasping.  
- CAD-modeled connectors with integrated silicone surfaces for secure, gentle contact.  
- Tools used: FDM/SLA 3D printing, laser cutting, CNC micro-fabrication.  

I contributed to the **actuator design, fabrication, and control testing**, optimizing performance for maneuverability and durability.  

This project demonstrates how soft robotics can support underwater exploration, environmental monitoring, and interaction with fragile objects.
