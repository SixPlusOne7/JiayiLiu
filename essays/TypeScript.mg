*TypeScript adds structure to JavaScript and makes learning smoother for beginners and professionals alike.*

When I first encountered TypeScript, I thought it was really cool. Because it is a superset of JavaScript, it makes the transition easier for people who already know Java or other typed languages. Earlier, when I taught myself web development using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, I didn’t even know TypeScript existed. Looking back, I realize that if I had used TypeScript at the time, I would have understood JavaScript more quickly thanks to the added type safety.  

## In the context of learning

From this module, I learned that JavaScript and TypeScript allow you to create objects in multiple ways without necessarily needing a class. You can use object literals, factory functions, or even `Object.create()`. You can also assign functions to variables, which shows the flexibility of the language. These concepts were new to me, and they deepened my understanding of how objects work under the hood.

## In the context of software engineering

From a software engineering perspective, I think TypeScript is a great language. It catches many errors at compile time, which helps both beginners and experienced developers. For large projects, TypeScript improves reliability and readability, while for new learners, it guides them toward better coding practices. Overall, it feels like a tool that makes JavaScript development less error-prone and more professional.  

## In the context of athletic software engineering

The practice WODs were stressful for me. As a mechanical engineering major, I am not used to coding every day, and programming is a skill that requires constant practice. I compared it to my piano training: just like practicing sight reading and scales built speed and coordination, WODs push us to become faster and more fluent programmers.

It is tough, but it does push my limits and helps me improve. Even though it has affected my grades, I know this style of learning will benefit me in the long run.  

## Final thoughts

For me, programming is like music—it takes daily effort, repetition, and persistence to build fluency. TypeScript gives me confidence by reducing errors, and athletic software engineering provides a training style that builds discipline. I will keep practicing and do my best to balance the stress with steady progress.
