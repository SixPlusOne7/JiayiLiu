*I want to combine programming with digital art to create fun, interactive media.*

I am interested in software engineering because I want to use programming as a way to create fun interactive media. I have always enjoyed digital art, and I like the idea of combining those skills with coding to build something creative, like a game, app, or website. For me, software engineering feels like a way to bring art and technology together.

In this course, I hope to learn how to use programming languages and frameworks to make projects that are not only functional but also enjoyable to use. I want to practice coding in ways that allow me to design interactive features, add animations, and create smooth user experiences. By improving these skills, I think I will be able to turn my ideas into real projects that people can actually try out.

I am also looking forward to learning about teamwork and the tools used in professional software development. Things like version control with GitHub, writing clean code, and following good design practices will help me work better with others and make my projects more organized. These are skills that will prepare me not just for this class, but for future opportunities in both software and creative fields.

In the end, my goal is to create a project that combines my programming knowledge with my art background. I think building something that is both technically strong and artistically interesting would be a great way to show who I am as a student and what I can do.
