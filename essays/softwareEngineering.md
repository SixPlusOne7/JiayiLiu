*I want to combine programming with digital art to create fun, interactive media.*

I am interested in software engineering because I want to use programming as a way to create fun interactive media. I have always enjoyed digital art, and I like the idea of combining those skills with coding to build something creative, like a game, app, or website. For me, software engineering feels like a way to bring art and technology together.  

In this course, I hope to learn how to use programming languages and frameworks to make projects that are not only functional but also enjoyable to use. I want to practice coding in ways that allow me to design interactive features, add animations, and create smooth user experiences. By improving these skills, I think I will be able to turn my ideas into real projects that people can actually try out.  

On Instagram I saw a girl who was able to craft a small desktop app instantly for her friend (a simple egg timer). The app used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but to make it look polished she also used Procreate to design custom icons and animations. In the end it turned out to be a really neat and cute app. Seeing how quickly she moved from idea to finished product was inspiring, and it showed me how powerful it can be to combine technical skills with artistic tools.  

She inspired me because that process of combining code with design was really cool, and it made me realize that programming doesn't need to feel distant or abstract. It can be personal and fun. I aspire to create something similar: a project where my own art style becomes part of the user experience. In the future, I hope to take what I learn in this course and experiment with projects that bring together design and engineering in meaningful ways. My goal is to build something that is both technically strong and artistically interestingâ€”something that reflects not just what I know, but also who I am.
