*Good communication in software engineering starts with asking the right questions.*

## Introduction

Communication is one of the most important skills in software engineering. Teams that communicate effectively can transfer information more quickly, avoid misunderstandings, and save time. Poor communication can sometimes lead to disasters. One famous example is NASA's Mars Climate Orbiter mission, where two teams used different units of measurement but failed to communicate this difference, resulting in the loss of the spacecraft and hundreds of millions of dollars. Asking questions the "smart way" is a key communication skill. According to Eric Raymond, this means doing research before asking, providing details and specific needs when asking, and following up properly after asking. In this essay, I'll compare one "smart" StackOverflow question with one "not smart" question to highlight the importance of asking questions well.  

## Smart question analysis

The first example comes from StackOverflow, where a developer wanted to know how to format multi-line code examples inside Javadoc comments. The question included a small, clear code snippet, showed the exact output problem, and asked directly what the best way was to format code in Javadoc.

The original question: [Multiple line code example in Javadoc comment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/541920/multiple-line-code-example-in-javadoc-comment)  

This follows Raymond's guidelines because the asker showed effort, described the problem clearly, and asked a specific question. The responses were efficient: community members explained the correct use of `<pre>` tags and gave clean examples. The asker quickly got the solution.  

## Not smart question analysis

The second example is not as effective. The question was: *"How to find out mount partition a directory or file is on Linux server"*. It was vague, had poor grammar, and lacked details such as the environment or what the asker had already tried.  

<img width="400px" class="rounded mx-auto d-block p-3" src="../img/Screenshot 2025-09-11 at 7.48.20 PM.jpg">

The original question: [How to find out mount partition a directory or file is on Linux server](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3274354/how-to-find-out-mount-partition-a-directory-or-file-is-on-linux-server)  

This violates Raymond's precepts because it does not show prior effort or provide a clear context. The responses reflected this: answers were minimal, sometimes dismissive, and not very helpful. The vague wording wasted time for both the asker and the readers.  

## Insights

These examples show that smart questions invite better answers, while vague ones waste time. For me, this lesson also applies in school. When I struggle with homework or projects, I try to figure things out on my own first—experimenting, searching online, or reading the textbook. This is like asking questions the smart way.  

But there are downsides. Spending too much time searching can be inefficient, especially with deadlines. In those cases, it may be better to first build a basic understanding, then go directly to a TA or professor with a clear, specific question. That way, I show effort while also saving time. There's an old Chinese saying: *"读万卷书，不如行万里路，不如名师指点"* — reading ten thousand books is not as good as traveling ten thousand miles, and even that is not as good as having a wise teacher give you guidance. This reminds me that self-learning is important, but sometimes the smartest move is asking the right person the right question.
