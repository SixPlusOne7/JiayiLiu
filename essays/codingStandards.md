When I think of coding standards, I understand why they matter. Consistency makes projects easier to read, share, and maintain. If everyone writes code in the same style, the whole team benefits. I don’t really disagree with that.  

But after my first week of using ESLint in ICS 314, I can’t honestly say I find it worth it yet. During timed Workouts of the Day, ESLint feels more like an obstacle course than a helper. I’ll be focused on solving the actual problem, only to get stuck fixing red squiggles about missing returns, unused variables, or spacing. In those moments, the rules feel more like punishment than support.  

That said, I can’t deny that ESLint has pushed me to learn more shortcuts in VS Code and to write cleaner, more consistent code. The “right answer” is that these small habits will pay off in the long run, and maybe I’ll come to appreciate the tool more as time goes on. Right now, though, the pain overshadows the benefits.
